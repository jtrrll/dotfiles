## Working Style

2. **Type Safety**: Prefer strongly-typed solutions with input validation at boundaries
3. **Error Handling**: Explicitly handle error and return descriptive, actionable errors
4. **Design By Contract**: Assert preconditions, postconditions, and invariants when types alone cannot express a contract
5. **Self-Documenting Code**: Write legible, descriptive code instead of inline comments
6. **Maintainability**: Prefer composition to inheritance and optimize for maintainability and simplicity before performance
7. **Performance**: Optimize performance for a snappy user experience
8. **Testing**: Write table-driven unit tests for all public functions and integration tests for new features and user flows
